# Anchor-resource-management-in-the-cloud

Anchor, a general resource management architecture that uses the stable matching framework to decouple policies from mechanisms when mapping virtual machines to physical servers. . In Anchor, clients and operators are able to express a variety of distinct resource management policies as they deem fit, and these policies are captured as preferences in the stable matching framework. The highlight of Anchor is a new many-to-one stable matching theory that efficiently matches VMs with heterogeneous resource needs to servers, using both offline and online algorithms

This repo has the Revised DA Algorithm and it's test cases. THe test cases files can also be created using the python file in this repo.
